# Belly button bacteria diversity

## Project goal
The datset includes the bacteria species present in human belly buttons. The goal of this project is to make an interactive webpage whereby the user can choose a patient from the dropdown menu and then view interactive charts (bar, bubble, and guage) which detail the bacteria found for that chosen subject and how often the subject washed their belly button.

## Method
D3 library was used to read in samples.json
plotly was used to create the bar, bubble, and guage charts
bootsrap customizations were used to add in a header image, descriptive paragraph, and modify the webpage layout.

The webpage was deployed on github pages and can be found here:
